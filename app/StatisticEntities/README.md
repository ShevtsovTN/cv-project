# Overview
The classes in this folder represent the flow of obtaining statistics from a third-party provider. Each provider includes a configuration class that implements the ProviderConfigInterface and a specialized collection class that implements the ProviderCollectionInterface. By using these providers along with their configuration and collection classes in console commands, we can flexibly configure different implementations for processing statistical data from the provider.

## Detailed Description
### ProviderConfigInterface

- This interface defines the methods required for a provider's configuration class. The configuration class is responsible for managing settings and parameters necessary for connecting and interacting with the third-party provider.
- Each provider's configuration class should implement this interface to ensure a consistent approach to managing configurations across different providers.

### ProviderCollectionInterface

- This interface outlines the methods required for a provider's specialized collection class. The collection class handles the retrieval and management of statistical data from the provider.
- By implementing this interface, each provider's collection class can ensure it adheres to a standardized method of data handling, allowing for easier integration and data processing.

### Integration with Console Commands

- The design allows for the integration of providers, along with their configuration and collection classes, into console commands. This integration enables the flexible setup and execution of different implementations for processing statistical data.
- By leveraging these console commands, users can easily switch between different providers and configurations, facilitating a modular and adaptable approach to data processing.

### Flexibility and Customization

- The system's modular design provides significant flexibility, allowing developers to add new providers or update existing ones with minimal disruption.
- Custom configurations and collection implementations can be tailored to meet specific requirements, enhancing the overall adaptability of the data processing workflow.
